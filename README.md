Water Quality and Potability

Water is very important to the continuity of life and is one of the six essential nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals). Approximately 70% of the plants are covered with water, but only 2.5% are suitable for drinking or cultivation. As humans use more water, it's getting harder to find water for consumption, whether it's because of fertilizers, industrial pollution, or excessive usage of water, which causes the groundwater reservoirs in densely populated cities to shrink. And with increasing population density, we need more water and food, so one of the solutions is water desalination to make it potable. In order to assess quality Potability , which is the suitability of water for human consumption, we need quality measurements and assessments.
